# MIDI Synth

This application is a analog synthesizer simulation built on the [Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/). It is very loosely based on the architecture of a [Moog Prodigy](http://www.vintagesynth.com/moog/prodigy.php) synthesizer, although this is a polyphonic synthesizer, and it lacks the oscillator sync and glide effects of the Prodigy. (AKA: this is not intended to be a replication of the Prodigy, so pleased don't tell me how crappy a reproduction it is! :)
