is a demo site for Bloggification of all 3Blue1Brown content.\nEventually, all videos will be incorporated into this project, but for now we have a single post available for Fourier transforms.\nPlease let us know how you feel about this type of content!\nWe will hopefully be allowing community contributions in the near future, but are still deciding the best way to do this.\nNotes and features:\n\nThere should be a \"Print\" and \"Blog\" mode for each post, where the blog mode may have short video clips interspersed, or potentially other bits of interactivity in the future, while print mode is meant to be printed and read offline (potentially). To switch between these modes, click on the \"PRINT\" or \"BLOG\" button at the top left of the toolbar.\nAll images are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike. This means that all the content can be used in any project for non-commercial purposes as long as there is attribution to Grant Sanderson and there are no changes to the license of derivative work.\nNext to the Blog / Print switch button, there is an \"A\" you can use to change the theme to dark or sepia if you wish.\nThis is a work in progress and is still missing a few features.\n\nDesired Feedback\nThere are a few specific questions we would like to ask about this content:\n\nWould you find written versions of the videos useful?  If so, in what ways?\nIs the print mode useful to you? Could you see this style of content being useful in a classroom or as a leisurely read over the weekend?\nWhat about a physically printed version of several 3Blue1Brown series?\nCould you see yourself or others you know being willing to help with a project like this?\nOne of the motives here is to have a place where future experimental projects related to videos can live, for example embedding quizzes or spaced repetition memory. Can you think of other such supplemental features which could complement the content?\n\n"},"contents/how_to_contribute/how_to_contribute.html":{"url":"contents/how_to_contribute/how_to_contribute.html","title":"How to Contribute","keywords":"","body":"How to Contribute\nThis blog series is lead by Grant Sanderson, but curated entirely by the community.\nIf there is an error in any of the blog posts or you feel the post does not capture the essense of a video topic, please feel free to create an issue on github and we will be more than willing to discuss it.\nTo start, the blog has been populated with a series of stub articles, each containing the video that will eventually be transformed into text.\nIf you would like to help in this process, we have created a master overview for all of the videos that still need bloggification and the steps left before the content is complete and ready to be put up on the site.\nGit and Version Control\nFor those who might not be familiar with git and version control, please send any questions you might have to James Schloss.\nIn addition, you might want to check out the following resources:\n\nDiscord\nGit resources\n\nWe strongly encourage contributors to create a local fork and branch to work from that can easily become a Pull Request onto the master branch of the blog.\nBefor merging, all content will undergo a rigorous review process by Grant, James, or other members of the community.\nIf you would like to speed up the process for everyone, please consider helping out with reviews!\nBuilding with Honkit\nHonkit is used for the purposes of the 3Blue1Brown Blog.\nTo install, use:\nnpm install honkit\nnpm install\nTo run the site locally, use\nnpx honkit serve\nor\nnpm run serve\nAfter everything is built, you should be able to look at the site at http://localhost:4000 (or something similar).\nLicensing\nAll content for the 3Blue1Brown Blog is under Creative Commons...\nThe key exception here is for the Pi Creatures, which are trademarked by Grant Sanderson under ...\nFormatting and content generation\nFor the content of this blog, we are trying our best to keep the content as close to the video source as possible; however, there will inevitably be small variations.\nEach post will be composed of:\n\nThe video source at the top of the page\nThe contents of the video in text form with short video clips scattered throughout.\nLicensing notices at the bottom\n\nIn general, please use the following guidelines when creating content for the 3Blue1Brown Blog:\n\nTry to keep the text as close as possible to the video source\nWhen creating video clips, cut out the audio and try to keep the video as short as possible, while still showing the key visualizations\nBe sure to place your name in the licensing at the bottom of the page and in grey text under the main title\nMake sure all images and graphics have appropriate licensing at the bottom of the page\n\nIn general, the workflow for creating blog content should be the following:\n\nFind a video that you would like to transcribe and find the video in the M\nOnce a video has been chosen, update the Master Overview to let others know you are working on the video and then create a fork of the blog and also a branch within that fork for the blog content\nCreate a script for the video and create any necessary graphics\nCreate a Pull Request for the video and wait for review\n\nIf you need any specific examples, please look at the finished chapters in the Master Overview, such as:\n\nFourier transforms (ADD LINK)\nWhatever else we do\n\nHow to use the master overview\nThe master overview is a list of all videos on the 3blue1brown channel.\nAll of the videos that need transcription can be found here in various levels of completion.\nHow to create a script\nThe easiest way to write the script is to watch the video and simultaneously write what you hear into a markdown file.\nAfter this process, simply go through the file and check for typos or any phrases that do not seem to make sense when written down.\nFinally, check the spelling of the file (if necessary, use a tool like aspell -c file.md).\nHow to create graphics\nMost of the graphics for the 3Blue1Brown Blog should be direct clips from the source video;
